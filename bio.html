<p style="font-size:30px; color:brown">I started my training in computer science with strong enthusiasm for research,
      but soon I felt that the comforts provided by modern science and technology 
      do not offer deep and lasting happiness to human beings.
      To be truly happy, we must engage in a deep quest about life, death and the cause and cure of of sorrows.
  I became a monk so that I could devote myself fully towards resolving these questions 
      and helping all beings through that.</p>
