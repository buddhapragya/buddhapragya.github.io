<p style="font-size:30px; color:green">I started my training in computer science with strong enthusiasm for research,
      but soon I felt that the fleeting pleasures offered by developments in modern science and technology 
      do not offer deep and lasting happiness to human beings.
      To be truly happy, we must ask and find answers to fundamental questions like what is a human being,
      why are we here and why must we be born and grow old and die. 
  Resisting all parental pressures to make money and get married, 
  I became a monk so that I could devote myself fully towards resolving these questions 
      and helping all beings through that.</p>
